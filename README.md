## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how you can help keep Miyomi up-to-date:

### Adding or Updating Apps

Navigate to `src/data/apps.json` and add or update app entries:

```json
{
  "id": "app-id",
  "name": "App Name",
  "status": "discontinued",
  "author": "Author or Team Name",
  "contentTypes": ["Manga", "Anime", "Light Novel"],
  "description": "Brief description of the app",
  "platforms": ["Android", "iOS", "Windows", "Mac", "Linux", "Web"],
  "iconColor": "#FF6B9D",
  "logoUrl": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/username",
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
  "supportedExtensions": ["extension-id-1", "extension-id-2"],
  "lastUpdated": "2025-01-15",
  "githubUrl": "https://github.com/owner/repository",
  "officialSite": "https://example.com",
  "discordUrl": "https://discord.gg/invite",
  "tutorials": [

      "type": "video",
      "url": "https://youtube.com/...",
      "description": "Tutorial description"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Important:**
- `status`: Optional; accepted values like `"active", "discontinued"`, `"abandoned"`, `"suspended"`, `"dmca"`, `"dead"` render a badge beside the app name so users know its current lifecycle state. Use lowercase strings; custom labels will be title-cased automatically. Leave this field out for actively maintained apps.
- `author`: Optional; shown in the UI. Falls back to the GitHub repo owner if omitted.
- `githubUrl`: If provided, the app will fetch live release data from GitHub
- `lastUpdated`: Acts as fallback when GitHub API is unavailable
- `contentTypes`: Must be one of: "Manga", "Anime", "Light Novel"
- `platforms`: Must be one of: "Android", "iOS", "Windows", "Mac", "Linux", "Web"

  "types": ["Anime", "Manga"],
  "region": "ALL",
  "accentColor": "#FF6B9D",
  "autoUrl": "aniyomi://add-repo?url=...",
  "manualUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...",
  "website": "https://github.com/...",

  "info": "Brief description",
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
  "lastUpdated": "2025-01-15"
}
```

**Region Codes:**
- Use ISO country codes (e.g., "US", "BR", "FR", "JP")
- Use "ALL" for global extensions
- Multiple regions: "BR,TR" (comma-separated)
